## Background

I have been an avid fan of Final Fantasy since I was a kid. I completed FFT several times decades ago with War of the lions on my PSP back in the 2007s at the height of the PSP era. Recently, i had an itch for strategy FF series (with the releases of remake titles, triangle strategy & tactics ogre). I went into the rabit hole starting with Tzepish's tweak on the FFT:WOTL, where he incuded some quality of life changes. I enjoyed the game until around 70 to 80 percent at chapter 4 where after getting the dark knight classes, i started to steamroll every encounter. Essentially the larger problem was that for many veterans of the series, the game is relatively easy - which is a large problem and so many people then went on to handicap themselves for replayability. Commnon plain points:

- Jobs are very imbalanced. Especially Dark knights & Arithmeticians/Calculators. This means you really probably going to level jobs just to unlock the end game versions while most are very under-utilize
- A lot of characters joins your roster but most of them are "useless" and overlooked
- Enemy encounters are mostly archers, thiefs, knights... And mostly very easy with no varieties 

## Getting into difficulty mods

When it comes to difficulty mods, perhaps the most "prominent" mod will be the FFT 1.3 mod by Archael and Insane Difficulty (the original site no longer exisits, just a archive backup). I was no stranger to this mod. Funny thing was that I was reading a lot about this mod several years back but was afraid of trying it since it had the reputation of causing many frustration to players due to the unfairness. However, this was the philosphy that the mod author wanted to accomplish. A lot of reviews still do not recommend it. However, watching a playthrough by DaTruth on youtube actually piqued my interest. 

Inspired by one player, I actually modified the original 1.3.08 patch for myself: I basically converted all the story mode encounters to static level instead of the original where story mode's encounter scale to player level. You might think: Isn't this the same as the FFT 1.3: Content/ easy mode that the original author built? The difference is that in the content version that was released:

1) There was further nerfed to the bosses/ enemies' equipment and reaction skills 
2) The content version does not include some of the latest changes in terms of skill nerfs and enemy content 

This meant that the version I am playing is harder that the "content" version but "easier" than the original 1.3.08. All versions are very much harder than the vanilla FFT. After 130 hours - i finally completed the story leaving only the optional dungeon content. I really enjoyed the difficulty and inspired me to build a mod for people to enjoy. 

## What I learnt from 1.3 and other "difficult" mods

My modified "content" of 1.3.08 is fun. Here are what i like about:

1) All characters and classes are utilized throughout the game. When i played the vanilla version, I am able to steamroll the game with dark knights, and some of the usual NPCs: Agrias, Orlandu...etc Characters like Beowulf, Reis, Worker 8 and many others can be ignored. However, during my own playthrough of 1.3, every characters needs be utilized to complete various encounters (or at least the way i solve the challenges).
2) Because i removed the penalty of grinding (Archael's version punishes grinding) - due to point 1, I had to level and grind MANY characters. But this is not a penalty to myself since I enjoy grinding. And the fact that you WILL utilize ALOT of characters encourages you to grind. 
3) The balancing to the jobs, abilities are really refreshing. A lot of classes which are "useless" are also useful now. In the vanilla, you simply only need a subset of classes. Here, similar to point 1, a lot of encounters can be solved with a wide variety of classes which makes it really refreshing to play. This means that motivation to grind other characters are justified.
4) I love the bosses. They are an actual threat, even the notorious final boss. (many people claimed she is impossible) I actually cleared the final boss in a single try - despite people saying she is impossible. She is not and is doable with a well thought-out team. I am by no means a master player... 

However, as I mentioned, given that I am not playing the intended difficulty of 1.3 but the "content" version, I can see where people are coming from. Even from my modified version, there were insane spikes towards the end even on my version: especially the final sequences where enemies are overpowered: imagine mages with no charges (instant spell) and the instant reraises. However, the intend of the author was to force the players to perform sole assassination. This meant that there are certain fights that the author intended for the player to carry out the fight and punishes freedom for players that love to clear all enemies. 

Another point that people often bring out is the fact that enemies have the abilities to sandbag with instant recovery while this option is not open to the players. This is a tough balance because it often mean you need to have burst damange to take out the item carriers. 

There are also many authors that have interesting ideas that do not want to punish the players with unfairness: cerabow, Laggy...etc I believe cerabow borrowed many ideas from 1.3 as well. I am also inspired by them to create something that is challenging but more reasonable. 

## Goal

Why do I want to recreate a challenge mod when there are so many out there? It started as a passion project for me to create highly replayable FFT with heavily inspired difficult encounters (especially with NG+). Also, 1.3 is no longer in development and there are some vision that I do not really agree with. Hence, I want to release a mod that is fun to play in my perspetive. 

With some advancement to the mods (thanks to the FFhacktics community) - I want to bring a mod that is very heavily inspired by the very talented mod authors: Archael from 1.3, cerabow, laggy...etc Overall my vision is as follows:

1) **Encourage grinding** - Some mods aims to punish the need to grind. However, what I love about RPGs is the freedom to grind. In fact, from my own content of 1.3, grinding made the encounters managable but still much tougher than vanilla. Hence, I want a mod that does not really punishes grinding as opposed to 1.3.
2) **New game plus**: Subsequent new game will bring to the table tougher enemies. This complements point 1 that grinding does not make the encounters so easy to the point like Vanilla. At your subsequent playthrough, enemies will now come with higher levels and better equipments! You can treat first playthrough as exploration. Be wared, it will still be tougher than vanilla. 
3) **More endgame contents beyond Deep-dungeon**: Now - experience tougher Rendezvous missions from WOTL. I want to include fair reasonable deep dungeon encounters. 1.3 does throw deep dungeon's balance out of the window. Several encounters are VERY tough and required niche strategies (which was intended)
4) **Balanced classes**. Mods like 1.3 and cerabow make balancing to the jobs such that every job are useful and some encounters do require certain jobs. You no longer converge to a few ultimate classes that allows you to steamroll the game blindly. Some of the mods actually make classes fun to play (E.g new archer skills, rebalanced arithmeticians/calculators). 
5) Further balances to the new characters from WOTL. (Balthier...etc)
