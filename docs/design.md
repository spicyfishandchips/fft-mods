# Goal

1) Rebalance in some mechanics, jobs, spells and itemization. Certain weapons, jobs and characters are less useful. This resulted in less "viable" options. E.g in the base WOTL game, dark knight jobs, arithmetician as well as Orlandeau are damn right broken that you other jobs are "less" attractive to play or are not required at all  
2) Enemies formation through the game are limited and not challenging. This probably also lead to point number 1 where players can simply brute force through without job variety and certain jobs are enough to "power" through them. The goal is to include more variety of enemy placements and enemy jobs which makes it more challenging   
3) More endgame options: Deep Dungeon challenges with tougher but reasonable challenges. More rendezvous challenges and improvement over the WOTL versions. Also new game plus if your itch for the game is not resolve!
