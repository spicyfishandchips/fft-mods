## Background

I have been an avid fan of Final Fantasy since I was a kid. I completed FFT several times decades ago with War of the lions on my PSP back in the 2007s at the height of the PSP era. Recently, i had an itch for strategy FF series (with the releases of remake titles, triangle strategy & tactics ogre). I went into the rabit hole starting with Tzepish's tweak on the FFT:WOTL, where he incuded some quality of life changes. I enjoyed the game until around 70 to 80 percent at chapter 4 where after getting the dark knight classes, i started to steamroll every encounter. Essentially the larger problem was that for many veterans of the series, the game is relatively easy - which is a large problem and so many people then went on to handicap themselves for replayability.

## Getting into difficulty mods

When it comes to difficulty mods, perhaps the most "prominent" mod will be the FFT 1.3 mod. I was no stranger to this mod. Funny thing was that I was reading a lot about this mod several years back but was afraid of trying it since it had the reputation of causing many frustration to players due to the unfairness. However, this was the philosphy that the mod author wanted to accomplish. A lot of reviews still do not recommend it. However, watching a playthrough by DaTruth on youtube actually piqued my interest.
